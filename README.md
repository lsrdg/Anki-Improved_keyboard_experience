# ANKI - Improved Keyboard Experience

With this addon you can use the keys `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` to show the answer.
When you are seeing the back of the card (the answer), those keys will
act as `1`, `2`, `3` and `4` respectively, where `1` and `h` corresponds
to "wrong" and `4` and `l` to "very easy".

Pressing `u` will **u**ndo the last action (it is `CTRL-z` by default).

Pressing `i` let you **i**nsert new content on the current card (by default,
that's `e`). Useful for checking hidden information on the card.
There's nothing wrong with the original `e` shortcut, but `i` is closer
to the other keys (`h,j,k,l`) and makes sense as in "`i`nsert mode".

This addon is a fork from the [Right-hand reviews with
jkl;](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1310550323), which is a great addon!
The reason to move the keys one step to left (`h,j,k,l` in instead of 
`j,k,l,;`) is that `;` is placed on different places in different keyboard's
layouts. And it simply fits the Vi logic, ehe.

The `u` is based on the `z` function of
[Handy Answer Keys Shortcuts](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2090822731) addon.
But again, `u` makes more sense as `u`ndo.
